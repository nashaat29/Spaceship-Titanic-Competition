# Spaceship-Titanic-Competition
This project uses machine learning to predict whether passengers aboard the Spaceship Titanic were transported to an alternate dimension. By analyzing features like age, spending habits, and travel details, we built and optimized models to achieve accurate predictions. The best-performing model, Logistic Regression, achieved 77.97% accuracy.
